		<h2>In the News</h2><span><em>2/17/2011</em>
		
		<p>On Tuesday the 15th, a reporter from The Democrat and Chronicle came to our meeting and filmed our team in action. The video Mr. Dowd put together can be seen <a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011110217030">here</a>. The Democrat and Chronicle will also be running an article about our team in their newspaper.</p>

			<h2>Weekly Update: Week 3</h2><span><em>1/29/2011</em></span>
			
			<p>At this point in the season, it's crunch time!  We're working at top speeds to get ready to test our robot. Over the past week, each of our subteams have accomplished a lot.</p>
			
			<p>
			The web page team has worked on validating the html. In the case of emergency, they set up an emergency text message form through Twilio. Pretty soon, when you first arrive to the home page, you will be greeted by a panther that leaps across the screen. Also, they added and edited content like the slideshow.
			</p>
			
			<p>The programing team worked on codes for the lifter and the claw. They also tweaked the DS output and worked with electrical to decide the best methods for controlling the robot.</p>
			
			<p>CAD team completely changed the design of the arm to fix its problems. It's been changed to two belt rollers and now it doesn't have a hook. They also tweaked the elevator design to match the new arm for height.</p>
			
			<p>The electrical team has been working on castors and handles for the battery box. They soldered battery connectors, sanded edges on the battery box, and brainstormed ideas on how to control the claw, the elbow, and the mini bot. Also, as said earlier, they worked with programing team to decide controlling methods.</p>
			
			<p>Our mech team has been has been very busy, working on a final version of the gripper after they finished the prototype of the arm and gripper. Another part of our mech team (we have several sections) worked on the machining of the new wheel and started building a possible design. That same part of mech also built the frame of a minibot prototype, drilled holes in the prototype for electrical hook-ups, worked out bugs in CNC for five-inch minibot polycarbonate wheels, and also planned how to mount parts on the prototype frame. One more part of our mechanical team, the last one, worked on a wooden mock-up of the forklift. They also put bracing on the frame, altered the old design for the lift so that it incorporated manufactured parts, and got the mock-up lift attached to the base.</p>
			
			<p>We will be trying our hardest to be able to drive by the end of this week! Check back every week for our team's weekly updates!</p>

			<h2>Kickoff Frenzy</h2><img src="Images/photo 2.jpg" align="right" width="125" alt="A field element" /><span><em>1/8/2011</em></span>
		
			<p align="left">It's another year of Robotics, and so another exciting robotics kickoff!  Every FIRST robotics team around the world was getting pumped to find out this year's game. All of Rochesterâ€™s Robotics teams met at the Theater On The Ridge, waiting impatiently to see the introductory video. Keeping all in suspense, they forced us to wait outside and munch on donuts and hot drinks for a bit.  During the presentation preceeding the game video, Will.i.am made an appearance, saying that he admired all the young people who do this program and wished he did the same exact program in his High School career.  After what seemed like forever of waiting, the game was finally revealed and the game is called Logomotion.  You can view the animation of this game on our <a href="game.html">game page</a>.</p>

			<h2>Fundraising Fun</h2><span><em>12/5/10</em></span>
			
			<p>On Tuesday, November 23rd, the students from the Pittsford Panthers stood outside in the cold in front of the Five Guys in the Pittsford Plaza. Many of their families came, and almost everybody who walked in the door between the hours of 5:00 and 10:00PM asked to support the team when they ordered. Between friends, relatives, and all of the random people who walked in the door, Five Guys had one of their most successful fundraisers ever, and Team 3181 was rewarded with 20% of the profit, amounting to more then $350! Great work, team!</p>

			<h2>Five Guys Date Set - Tuesday the 23rd</h2> <span><em>11/10/2010</em></span>
			
			<p>If you go to Five Guys on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, make sure you ask that your purchase be on behalf of the Pittsford Panthers Robotics Team! From 5:00-10:00PM on Tuesday the 23rd, invite all of your family and friends to come and have some delicious food, and help the team while they're at it!</p>
			
			<hr />
		
			<h2>Five Guys Fundraiser!</h2> <span><em>11/3/2010</em></span>
			
			<p>During today's meeting, it was announced that the Pittsford Panthers Robotics Team will be participating in a fundraiser at <a href="http://www.fiveguys.com/home.aspx">Five Guys</a> in order to try to raise money and gain publicity for the team! This will probably happen either the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, or the Tuesday directly after. We'll need several members to participate if we want this to work, so make sure to keep your ears open at the next few meetings to get some more details and get the chance to sign up!</p>

			<h2>The Ra Cha Cha Ruckus - A Great Success</h2> <span><em>10/24/2010</em></span>
			
			<p>On Saturday, October 23rd, the Pittsford Panthers Robotics Team participated in their first "competition" of the season, the Ra Cha Cha Ruckus! The Ruckus is played using the previous season's robot in the previous season's game. We are proud to say that, despite struggling a bit in the competition last year, we've made huge strides that are evident even in such a competition as the Ruckus!</p>
			<p>On a field of 21 teams, the Panthers placed 6th. Being in the top 7, this also gave us the opportunity to pick our own teams to work with us through the playoffs. After advancing through the quarterfinals, we were swept two games to none against the alliance that ultimately won the competition. Great job team!</p>
			<p>In addition to our merits on the field, we walked away with a couple of rewards. Alex Cormier, a team mentor, got the Igor award for being a great volunteer. Furthermore, the team took home the Spellbinder award for having the best play of the day, the second year in a row we've won this award!</p>
			<p>We hope to take the momentum gained from our success in the Ruckus to fly into the new season, and hope for similar success in the upcoming competition!</p>
